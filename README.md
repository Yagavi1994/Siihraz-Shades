## Design

### Wireframes:
I took inspiration from a template in wix.com website. [Click Here](https://rb.gy/384srs) To view that template. I designed many features of my website with reference to this template. The portfolio and the contact pages were inspired from this one. This template acted as a guideline for me.

### Colour Scheme:
I wanted my colour palette to communicate makeup. So, I used two colors which are used majorly in makeup industry, that is caramel brown and charcoal grey, which also contrasted well with white background. Used [Rgba Color Picker](https://rgbacolorpicker.com/) to pick the colors.
![Caramel Brown](https://i.ibb.co/rbVRHmm/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-10-32-13-am.png)
![Charcoal Grey](https://i.ibb.co/pJxCg45/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-10-31-14-am.png)

### Typography:
I used 'Karla' font, since it was simple, professional and classy. It complimented well to the color palette and images. All the headings and paragraphs were used 'Karla' font with different font-weight and colours. The two font colors used were charcoal grey and white to keep it simple and readable.

### Imagery:
Apart from the Home page's cover image and Thank you page's background image, all the image are own images of the makeup artist. I chose few of the best pictures of herself and her work from her gallery which may look well for the website. Home page's cover image was taken from pngtree website and Thank you page's background image was taken from freepik website.

## Features

### Existing Features
#### Navigation bar:
This is included across all three pages, and provides people with an easy reference to navigate between the 'Home', 'Services' 'Reviews' 'Portfolio' & 'Contact' pages.

![Navigation bar](https://i.ibb.co/sQL7hQM/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-10-36-13-am.png)

#### Landing Page:
The landing page has the Logo Image which is displayed like a cover image at the top of the Home page.

I photoshopped the image with the official logo of the makeup artists company Siihraz Shades Makeover in it. The logo image defines the feel of the website, providing the user with an image that they can easily associate to what the company is & does.

![Logo image](https://i.ibb.co/JFGw7ZD/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-10-37-33-am.png)

The About me section is listed right beneath the Logo Image. It has the photo of the makeup artist and a brief explanation about her and her work.

![About me](https://i.ibb.co/0sm59J5/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-10-39-43-am.png)

The Landing Page also got Services and Reviews in it.

#### Services

The Services section explains about the different services done by the makeup artist with a picture of a model and brief explanation about it underneath.

![Services](https://i.ibb.co/KqsjbNj/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-10-43-13-am.png)

#### Reviews

And when you scroll below the Services section, there comes Reviews section which has few reviews about the makeup artist given by her clients.

![Reviews](https://i.ibb.co/MgWbDrX/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-10-45-10-am.png)

#### Portfolio:
The portfolio page consists of masonry grid of images of makeup artist's clients to display her work. The images can be clicked to open and view. Below that, there will be a youtube video of the makeup artist working with her client.

![Portfolio](https://i.ibb.co/Bsv7mTz/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-10-48-14-am.png)
![Video](https://i.ibb.co/SK1Hpkq/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-10-48-36-am.png)

#### Contact:
The contact page consists of form to fill for the audience to reach out to the makeup artist for consultation and below that there is contact information of the makeup artist to book an appointment with her. In small devices like mobile I have added scroll bar for the contact information, as the mail id and address seems to be very large for small screens. A google map of her location is added below it.

![Contact Form](https://i.ibb.co/z2pfxdX/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-11-44-12-am.png)

![Google Maps](https://i.ibb.co/413TbGV/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-10-52-29-am.png)

#### Thank You Page
A customised 'form dump' page saying 'Thank You' has also been included upon the instruction of the mentor who informed me that it was necessary if a form was added to the project. The Thank-You page opens once the user clicks the send button after fulfilling the required information in the form...

![Thank-You-Page](https://i.ibb.co/sbRbsvn/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-11-32-56-pm.png)

#### Footer:
#### Social Links
Links of Facebook and Instagram will take to the makeup artist's social media page which can be found on the bottom of each page at the footer. Youtube and Twitter links will take the user to the respective social media platform in a new tab.

![Social-Links](https://i.ibb.co/6NhkFBf/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-10-45-21-am.png)

#### Footer Comment
A comment has been added to the footer to indicate that the site is intended for educational purposes only. This has been done as the logo-image used was sourced from a google search, and I do not have the rights to the image. The image has been credited in this document.

#### 404 Error Page:
I have also added a customised 404 error page which can be seen when the url gets broken or failed to load for any reason.

### Future Features:
- Upgraded gallery with left and right buttons to navigate between images.
- A calender page of the artist to check her availability.
- A brochure of services provided by her with it's price range.
- To update with discounts during seasonal time.
- More rich and classy looking website.

## Testing and Challenges:
- I came across many challenges while creating this website. One of the major challenge which I kept facing again and again was positioning the contents in the centre of the page. Then after many trial and errors, I learned to create a parent div and give flex values to it helped me to centre the content in many places.
- I was confused at many places about what unit to use for size of the contents. Then I figured out using percentage helps in places where responsiveness is needed and in other places I mostly went with pixels.
- Initially I struggled a lot with images since it was not uploading when I added it to the images folder and used it's relative path. Then I remebered studying somewhere in lessons about image hosting site. I googled about the same and came across "Imgbb.com" website for image hosting, which helped to host my image and solve all my issues with it.
- Whenever I felt like my code is not giving the desired style I want, I would google my query and mostly I would find my answer in it.
- For Portfolio I wanted to create a gallery which when clicked should open and display the full image. I found a YouTube tutorial for the same and followed it to achieve the desired result.
- Similarly, to create the Masonry Grid of my Portfolio too I followed a YouTube tutorial.
- In contact page, the contact information was too long for small screens, so when was confused about what to do, got an idea of adding scroll bar to overflowing content which was learnt in lessons helped.
- I was not aware of form-dump page when clicked submit in the form, my mentor Martina pointed that out and after which I added a form-dump page to my form.
- I tested my website in all 3 screen sizes and which seems to work responsively without any error.
- I tested all my external links which also opens fine in new tabs.
- All my images seems to load perfectly without any delay in all browsers and devices.
- I tested my codes in validator, initially there was few errors about not to use "h1" anywhere other than main heading, stray tags, to use div instead of sections etc., and I corrected all those errors and recieved pass in the same for both HTML and CSS.
