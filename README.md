## Design

### Wireframes:
I took inspiration from a template in wix.com website. [Click Here](https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/2104?originUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wix.com%2Fwebsite%2Ftemplates%3Fcriteria%3DMake-up%2BArtist%26dashboardFirstMetaSiteId%3D1acdd41c-b62d-4aa7-93e9-2e95ac2a6cd9&tpClick=view_button&esi=b545a6b4-a951-441b-96b7-a55ea89b3cee&dashboardFirstMetaSiteId=1acdd41c-b62d-4aa7-93e9-2e95ac2a6cd9) To view that template. I designed many features of my website with reference to this template. The portfolio and the contact pages were inspired from this one. This template acted as a guideline for me.

### Colour Scheme:
I wanted my colour palette to communicate makeup. So, I used two colors which are used majorly in makeup industry, that is caramel brown and charcoal grey, which also contrasted well with white background.
![Colour Palette](Insert link of the color palette images)

### Typography:
I used 'Karla' font, since it was simple, professional and classy. It complimented well to the color palette and images. All the headings and paragraphs were used 'Karla' font with different font-weight and colours. The two font colors used were charcoal grey and white to keep it simple and readable.

### Imagery:
Apart from the Home page's cover image and Thank you page's background image, all the image are own images of the makeup artist. I chose few of the best pictures of herself and her work from her gallery which may look well for the website. Home page's cover image was taken from Google and Thank you page's background image was taken from free pik website.

## Features

### Existing Features
#### Navigation bar:
This is included across all three pages, and provides people with an easy reference to navigate between the 'Home', 'Services' 'Reviews' 'Portfolio' & 'Contact' pages.

![Navigation bar](Insert screenshot of your navigation bar)

#### Landing Page:
The landing page has the Logo Image which is displayed like a cover image at the top of the Home page.

I photoshopped the image with the official logo of the makeup artists company Siihraz Shades Makeover in it. The logo image defines the feel of the website, providing the user with an image that they can easily associate to what the company is & does.

## Testing
The Social links appeared to be connected with a hyphen that would open one of the social platforms in a new tab. I could not understand what had occured. After much deliberation & viewing the style rules one by one, making adjustments or removing them altogether, I fixed the issue by changing the display from "inline" to "inline-block".

Having placed my hero images, as well as the "times" image on the menu & locations banner, I was having an issue with the size of the images themselves. Either the images were zoomed in more than what they should be, or they were not showing at all, being too large for their containers. The issue with the hero image was resolved by adding the following style rule 
```
background-size:100% 100%;
```
This solution was brought to my attention in a thread found in Stackoverflow. The graphic in the menu/locations banner was then fixed by adding the images to the html documents as image elements, & then defining their size in the CSS rules. This same method was then used to add in additional images to each page.

Next I struggled with centring the different elements on the page, and often found that the elements would align to the left of the page, despite having set the rule to {margin:0 auto}. I fought with this issue for longer than I should, forcing the placements of the images with numerous style rules. Knowing that my method of attack was incorrect, I enlisted the assistance of my cousin, who then informed me that the main source of my frustration was the 
```
position:absolute;
```
rule, and directed me towards the 'flex' styling rules that immediately made things much easier & my code far less unruly.

Ran the html files through W3C validator. Upon initial run through, some sections failed. Once I removed the paragraph elements from the the unordered list elements, the issue was resolved.

The same happened with running the style rules through the CSS validator. Two rules hadn't been written correctly, but once amended, it passed without any errors.

I tried to add a static navigation panel at the top that would always be visible no matter how far down the page a user scrolled. However what ended up occurring, was that whilst I was able to achieve this, the section element below (such as the Hero Image), would then shift up in its placement & move behind the navigation element. The navigation element would also shift to the left of the page, & would need creative adjustments to the margins to return back to its original position of being centred. I was unable to figure out how to resolve this, and returned the navigation bar to its original design. I may revisit this feature later on & try to correct it.

The media queries proved to be a challenge. It took a lot of trial & error in the Chrome Dev tool to adjust everything accordingly so that it would not display horribly out of sync when the page was to be resized. I found undoing my horizontal alignments where I had applied flex styles to be particularly challenging, however eventually phrased my my conundrum correctly in my google search, & was able to locate the resolution on Stackoverflow.

As I moved through the different sizes of queries, managing the banner & wording I had overlaid on the hero image became near impossible. After several hours of fiddling and beating my head against the wall, I decided to try it from a new approach. I moved the banner png into the index.html file, and removed it as a background image from the css style sheet. This ultimately gave me more control over the size & continuous position of it, and allowed me to move it around the page & overlay the text much more effortlessly. What I did end up having to do however, was create a media query for each 100px bracket, as the overlaying text would still move to far. 

After a review of the project with my mentor, we decided it would be better to turn the initial "LA LUCHA" banner into a solitary image, instead of text overlaying a PNG, as this was still producing scaling issues where the text would move position across the banner when being sized.

Issues with placement of the images next to the descriptions was also resolved once I changed the flex rules applied, and removed any unnecessary pagging from around the parent element.

### Validator Testing:

### Unfixed Bugs:

## Technologies Used
### Main Languages Used:
- HTML5
- CSS3

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used:
- Google Fonts - for the font families: Karla was used for font. San-serif was used as a default font.
- Font Awesome - to add icons to the social links in the footer element.
- GitPod - to creat my html files & styling sheet before pushing the project to Github.
- GitHub - to store my repository for submission.
- Adobe Photoshop - were used to edit images and create mockups of the project in various devices.
- Favicon - to provide the code & image for the icon in the tab bar.
- Imgbb - to host my images, since directly adding my images to assets was not working as the size of images were huge.

## Credits

### Content:
As my knowledge of implementation is limited at this point in my learning, the initial set up & style was set loosely on the 'Love Running' walk-through project. From there, I took inspiration for the design of the navigation bar, along with the display of the social links in the footer element.

The styling of the form element in 'Love Running' was used as a starting point for my form to help remember all categories that needed to be addressed.

Stackoverflow [Reply](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16056591/font-scaling-based-on-width-of-container) was used to fix the issue with scaling font sizes, where I was reminded of how to size fonts with viewport widths & heights.

Stackoverflow [Reply](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1150163/stretch-and-scale-a-css-image-in-the-background-with-css-only) was used to fix the issue with image sizes within their containers, where I found the styling rule 
```
background-size: 100% 100%;.
```

Another useful site that also helped with my image sizing issues & explained it in more detail was [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-cropping-images-object-fit).


My cousin turned me on to [flex style rules](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/), & with those, I was finally able to fix my alignment issues both horizontally & vertically using the following three rules:
```
1. display:flex; 
2. align-items:center; 
3. justify-content:space-between;
```
Stackoverflow [Reply](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1150163/stretch-and-scale-a-css-image-in-the-background-with-css-only) supplied the style rules to stretch the text in the "locations" page banner.
```
1. transform: scaleY(2);
2. transform-origin: 0 0;
```
Stackoverflow [Reply](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63437323/how-to-remove-display-flex-in-media-query) provided the answer on how to undo my flex styling rule.

Stackoverflow [Reply](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4888377/how-to-add-a-browser-tab-icon-favicon-for-a-website) explained how to add an icon to the browser tab of the web page.

Support was provided by my fellow student [Mats](https://github.com/Pelikantapeten/p1-nacka-tomato-society) by aiding me in bouncing off ideas & venting frustrations. They were also immeasurably helpful in explaining Media Queries in a way that I was able to grasp. They also informed me that when creating a contact form, one most also create a form-dump page.
